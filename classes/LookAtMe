[reminder]

well the requirements for this classes to work fine are:

1. SDL2
2. SDL2_Image
3. Freeglut	(GL Utility Toolkit)
4. OpenGL
5. Glew (GL Extension Wrangler)


notes: 
	the SDL libraries act as replacement for jpeglib for loading
	jpeg images.
	
	Its a whole lot easier to do with SDL2_Image.

NB: 
	AND PLEASE DON'T TRY WRITING A 3DS LOADER FROM SCRATCH
	AGAIN, Eee GET WHY :(
